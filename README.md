# bw_code_challenge

This was a code challenge that I had to do for applying to a job. I had 48 hours to build this application. 



Run the following on the command prompt:
    "npm install"

This will get you all of the necessary packages to run the server


Once you run the server (npm start) you can go to port: 4646 in loccal host to see the web app.

The path for the login page is just "/login".


Since there are no users, just create your own profile, then you will be able to login.
